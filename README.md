# UCSD CSE100 Advanced Data Structures

hw1: Implementation of BST and KDT.

hw2: Lexicon and Autocomplete:	 Used a multiway trie implemented in C++ to implement a lexicon that can store millions of words. If given a prefix of any words, it is able to give auocomplete suggestions based on the data stored.

hw3: Used C++ and STL to write a Links Predictor that uses a graph data structure to store information of more than 10,000 real actors and their films. Able to find paths between actors through common films, predict who would act together in the future and find k-core within seconds
